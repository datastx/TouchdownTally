Gorilla WebSocket provides a simple and efficient way to work with WebSocket connections in Go, making it perfect for chat applications. The library includes excellent examples for building chat systems and handles all the complexities of WebSocket management.

### Database: **PostgreSQL**
PostgreSQL's advanced features, including Row-Level Security and JSON fields, make it ideal for multi-tenant applications. It handles concurrent access better than SQLite and provides a clearer migration path if scaling becomes necessary.

### Background Jobs: **River (Go + PostgreSQL)**
River is a robust high-performance job processing system for Go and Postgres that encourages using the same database for application data and job queue, providing transactional guarantees. River jobs never run before your transaction completes and are never lost - if your API's transaction succeeds, your job will be enqueued. This eliminates entire classes of distributed systems problems and provides exactly the reliability needed for daily score updates.

### Hosting: **Railway**
Railway offers the best developer experience with $10 monthly credits (effectively free for your traffic levels). It includes PostgreSQL and seamless deployment with zero configuration complexity. Go applications compile to single binaries making deployment extremely simple.

## Database Schema Design

The schema employs a shared database with row-level tenant isolation, optimal for your scale:

### Core Tables Structure

**Authentication & Users**
```sql
CREATE TABLE email_accounts (
    email_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    email_address VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    password_hash VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE TABLE user_profiles (
    user_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    email_id INTEGER REFERENCES email_accounts(email_id),
    username VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    display_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    UNIQUE(email_id, username)
);
```

**Pools & Memberships**
```sql
CREATE TABLE pools (
    pool_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    pool_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    pool_code VARCHAR(20) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    season_year INTEGER NOT NULL,
    created_by INTEGER REFERENCES user_profiles(user_id)
);

CREATE TABLE pool_memberships (
    membership_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    pool_id INTEGER REFERENCES pools(pool_id),
    user_id INTEGER REFERENCES user_profiles(user_id),
    role_id INTEGER REFERENCES roles(role_id),
    UNIQUE(pool_id, user_id)
);
```

**Season Picks & Scoring**
```sql
CREATE TABLE season_picks (
    pick_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    pool_id INTEGER REFERENCES pools(pool_id),
    user_id INTEGER REFERENCES user_profiles(user_id),
    team_id INTEGER REFERENCES nfl_teams(team_id),
    pick_order INTEGER CHECK (pick_order BETWEEN 1 AND 4),
    UNIQUE(pool_id, user_id, pick_order)
);
```

The schema includes comprehensive tables for NFL teams, games, standings, and chat functionality, all designed with multi-tenancy and future sports expansion in mind.

## NFL Data Integration

### Primary Solution: **MySportsFeeds (FREE)**
MySportsFeeds stands out as the ideal choice - completely free for personal/family use with no credit card required. It provides comprehensive NFL coverage including real-time scores, schedules, standings, and historical data with excellent documentation and reliability.

**Implementation Example:**
```python
import requests
import base64

class NFLDataUpdater:
    def __init__(self):
        self.api_key = "your_api_key"
        self.auth = base64.b64encode(f"{self.api_key}:MYSPORTSFEEDS".encode()).decode()
    
    def get_weekly_scores(self, week):
        url = f"https://api.mysportsfeeds.com/v2.1/pull/nfl/2024-regular/week/{week}/games.json"
        headers = {"Authorization": f"Basic {self.auth}"}
        response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)
        return response.json()
```

### Backup Option: **ESPN Unofficial API**
As a fallback, ESPN's unofficial API provides rich data without authentication requirements. While it could break without notice, it serves as an excellent zero-cost backup option.

## Authentication with Multiple Profiles

The system implements JWT-based authentication with session management that elegantly handles multiple profiles per email:

**Profile Management Flow:**
1. User logs in with email/password
2. System presents available profiles (e.g., "Dad", "Mom")
3. User selects active profile
4. JWT contains both user and active profile context
5. Profile switching available without re-authentication

**Go Implementation:**
```go
type UserProfile struct {
    UserID      int    `json:"user_id" db:"user_id"`
    EmailID     int    `json:"email_id" db:"email_id"`
    Username    string `json:"username" db:"username"`
    DisplayName string `json:"display_name" db:"display_name"`
}

type LoginResponse struct {
    Token    string        `json:"token"`
    Profiles []UserProfile `json:"profiles"`
}

func LoginHandler(c *gin.Context) {
    var req LoginRequest
    if err := c.ShouldBindJSON(&req); err != nil {
        c.JSON(400, gin.H{"error": err.Error()})
        return
    }
    
    account, err := authenticateEmail(req.Email, req.Password)
    if err != nil {
        c.JSON(401, gin.H{"error": "Invalid credentials"})
        return
    }
    
    profiles, err := getProfilesForEmail(account.EmailID)
    if err != nil {
        c.JSON(500, gin.H{"error": "Failed to get profiles"})
        return
    }
    
    token, err := generateJWT(account.EmailID, profiles[0].UserID)
    if err != nil {
        c.JSON(500, gin.H{"error": "Failed to generate token"})
        return
    }
    
    c.JSON(200, LoginResponse{
        Token:    token,
        Profiles: profiles,
    })
}
```

## Real-time Chat Implementation

Gorilla WebSocket provides the optimal solution for chat functionality with commissioner moderation capabilities:

**Server Setup:**
```go
// Hub maintains the set of active clients and broadcasts messages to the clients
type Hub struct {
    clients    map[*Client]bool
    broadcast  chan []byte
    register   chan *Client
    unregister chan *Client
    poolID     int
}

// Client is a middleman between the websocket connection and the hub
type Client struct {
    hub      *Hub
    conn     *websocket.Conn
    send     chan []byte
    userID   int
    poolID   int
    isCommissioner bool
}

func (h *Hub) run() {
    for {
        select {
        case client := <-h.register:
            h.clients[client] = true
            joinMsg := Message{
                Type:     "user_joined",
                Username: getUserDisplayName(client.userID),
                Content:  "joined the chat",
                Timestamp: time.Now(),
            }
            h.broadcastMessage(joinMsg)

        case client := <-h.unregister:
            if _, ok := h.clients[client]; ok {
                delete(h.clients, client)
                close(client.send)
                leaveMsg := Message{
                    Type:     "user_left", 
                    Username: getUserDisplayName(client.userID),
                    Content:  "left the chat",
                    Timestamp: time.Now(),
                }
                h.broadcastMessage(leaveMsg)
            }

        case message := <-h.broadcast:
            for client := range h.clients {
                select {
                case client.send <- message:
                default:
                    close(client.send)
                    delete(h.clients, client)
                }
            }
        }
    }
}

func serveWS(hub *Hub, w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    conn, err := upgrader.Upgrade(w, r, nil)
    if err != nil {
        log.Println(err)
        return
    }
    
    userID := getUserIDFromToken(r.Header.Get("Authorization"))
    isCommissioner := checkCommissionerStatus(userID, hub.poolID)
    
    client := &Client{
        hub:            hub,
        conn:           conn,
        send:           make(chan []byte, 256),
        userID:         userID,
        poolID:         hub.poolID,
        isCommissioner: isCommissioner,
    }
    
    client.hub.register <- client
    
    go client.writePump()
    go client.readPump()
}
```

**Commissioner Moderation Features:**
- Real-time message deletion with `DELETE_MESSAGE` command
- User timeout functionality with configurable duration
- Content filtering rules with automatic enforcement
- Moderation action logging for audit trails

**Message Handling:**
```go
func (c *Client) readPump() {
    defer func() {
        c.hub.unregister <- c
        c.conn.Close()
    }()
    
    for {
        _, messageBytes, err := c.conn.ReadMessage()
        if err != nil {
            break
        }
        
        var msg Message
        if err := json.Unmarshal(messageBytes, &msg); err != nil {
            continue
        }
        
        // Handle commissioner commands
        if c.isCommissioner && strings.HasPrefix(msg.Content, "/") {
            c.handleModeratorCommand(msg)
            continue
        }
        
        // Apply content filters
        if isMessageAllowed(msg.Content) {
            msg.UserID = c.userID
            msg.Username = getUserDisplayName(c.userID)
            msg.Timestamp = time.Now()
            
            messageBytes, _ := json.Marshal(msg)
            c.hub.broadcast <- messageBytes
        }
    }
}
```
